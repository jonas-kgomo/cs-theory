To test locally, make sure you have Node.js installed 
For example to run the solution for sorting problem, run `node javascript/sortList.js` to test the solution for sorting problem

To run from the file with all the solution, use `node --eval "require('./javascript/arrays.js').sortList()"`

## Algorithms 

1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array [sort.js]

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. (Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.)


2. Write a code that can convert intergers to Roman numerals (20 min)

>I = 1, X= 10, IX= 9, XI= 11, L =50, C= 100, D= 500, M= 1000
