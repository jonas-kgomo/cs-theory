# Algorithms 

1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


2. Write a code that can convert intergers to Roman numerals (20 min)

I = 1, X= 10, IX= 9, XI= 11, L =50, C= 100, D= 500, M= 1000
